This is a dolphin game created on the RAGE engine (not the one by Rockstar), which was created and maintained by previous graduate students at CSUS. 

For this game, you move around as a dolphin, dashing to planets with a chase camera (no spring system yet) and collecting by visiting the planets. There are also All-Sporks
which you collect for points. This is a basic game to learn the features of the RAGE engine, and it includes a HUD, local two player, controller support, and use of node controllers.
